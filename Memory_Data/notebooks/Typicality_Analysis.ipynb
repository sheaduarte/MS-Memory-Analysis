    "1. Import & concatenate data:\n",
    "- Write a function that takes a folder of data files as an argument and concatenates all the .csv files in that folder into a single pandas dataframe.\n",
    "    - *hint*: use the packages \"glob\" and \"pandas\"\n",
    "    - *hint2*: you need to skip the first three rows of each .csv file for this to work.\n",
    "2. Average response score for each object.\n",
    "- Get a summary of the average score for each object shown.\n",
    "    - *hint*: There are a couple of ways to do this, you can use the *.groupby()* method in pandas to group items in the 'object_shown' column, or you can create a pivot table.\n",
    "- Check whether any objects have average response scores lower than 6.\n",
    "3. Find the images we want to use.\n",
    "- Group by images (in the 'stim1' column) and get the average score for each stim1. \n",
    "    - *hint* use the .groupby() and .mean() methods\n",
    "- For each object, find the two highest-scored images that have the same score. \n",
    "    - If no two objects have the same score, list the two highest scores for each object. \n",
    "    - If more than two objects have matching highest-scores, list all of them."
